McAPI
=====

McAPI is a simple utlitity to get information about Minecraft server. It
will return a lot of information. - McAPI will support a lot of differet
versions (1.7.x [done], 1.7.10 [done], 1.6 [done], 1.5 [in work], 1.4
[in work], 1.3 [in work]). I use it in my own projects (e.g. http://mcapi.sweetcode.de) in the next weaks I will add more functions like Votifier-Vote, Avatars, UUID-Support and more awesome stuff based on my old project. When you have ideas you can send me a pull-request or a message. If I like your idea and if I thing that your idea is usefull than I will add it to the project and I will list your name in this read-me and in the new McAPI (3.0). The final release date for McAPI 3.0 is 1/1/2015. More news can you find on my homepage (http://sweetcode.de) or on twitter (http://twitter.com/yonascode).

Stay tuned for more awesome stuff. I .heart you. ^^
